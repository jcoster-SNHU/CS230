# CS230
CS 230 Final Project 

The team at The Gaming Room has asked us to develop the web version of their game “Draw it or Lose it” which is loosely based off the 1980’s tv game “Win, Lose, Draw”. The game involves teams guessing an image being rendered from a stock image library over the course of one-minute rounds. The drawings are fully rendered at the 30 second market and if the guessing team cannot complete the puzzle, the opposing team will have 15 seconds to guess and steal the points. The Gaming Room team does not know how to set up the environment and has tasked us with streamlining development. 
Requirements
•	The game must be web based and accessible across all modern operating systems: Windows, IOS, Android, etc. 
•	The game must allow for online connection between players on different devices for multiplayer play.
•	The game must be able to store in game data to track scores during a session.
•	The game must let multiple players connect to the same instance at once.

I think during the develoment of the documentation I handled the majority of tasks well, but especially the understanding of the different constraints and how the project should be hosted on a cloud database for a web based game. I think I captured the overall requirements and how to meet them as best I could.

I think working through the design document helped me slow down and asses each part of the process in a more thorough manner instead of rushing through to the coding portion as fast as I can. Taking time to compare and contrast the different options for development helped me really pick the best choice for the build. 

I think I would like to go back and expand upon some of the server and client side data points for the comparison table now that I understand those pieces better. I would be more specific about the different aspects of each to differentiate the two for a non technical audience. 

When building a project like this, considering a users needs is key to a smoother development process. Understanding how "Draw it or Lose it" is intended to function drives how you decide to build the code, and meeting with the user throughout the design phase to go back and forth to confirm everyone is on the same page will help make sure the user's requirements can be met as much as possible. 

When approaching software design, I try to adhere to the software development lifecycle and agile development practices as much as possible to help guide me during the build. I would try to incorporate different testing phases as I completed each feature module to keep track of the milestones I needed to reach for the customers requirements.
